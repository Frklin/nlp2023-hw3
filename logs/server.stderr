2024-02-09T17:38:46.641821316Z Some weights of the model checkpoint at bert-base-cased were not used when initializing BertModel: ['cls.predictions.bias', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.LayerNorm.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.bias', 'cls.predictions.decoder.weight', 'cls.predictions.transform.dense.weight']
2024-02-09T17:38:46.641838234Z - This IS expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
2024-02-09T17:38:46.641839890Z - This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModel from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
